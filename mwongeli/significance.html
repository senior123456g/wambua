    <div class="content">
        <!-- Mountain Significance -->
        <div class="landform">
            <h2>1. Mountains</h2>
            <img src="images/pexels-pixabay-210243 (1).jpg" alt="Mountain Diagram" class="landform-diagram">
            <p><strong>Climate Regulation:</strong> Mountains influence weather patterns by causing air to rise, cooling and condensing, which results in precipitation.</p>
            <p><strong>Water Sources:</strong> Mountains act as sources of freshwater, feeding rivers and lakes with meltwater from glaciers and snow.</p>
            <p><strong>Natural Barriers:</strong> They serve as natural barriers to movement, both for wildlife and human activities, but also provide protection from winds and harsh weather.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Valley Significance -->
        <div class="landform">
            <h2>2. Valleys</h2>
            <img src="images/pexels-bogdan-r-anton-338246-1005256.jpg" alt="Valley Diagram" class="landform-diagram">
            <p><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Valleys are often fertile regions due to the deposition of nutrients carried by rivers. They are prime locations for farming.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Valleys provide habitats for various plant and animal species, offering water and shelter.</p>
            <p><strong>Human Settlements:</strong> Valleys are typically preferred for human settlements due to their availability of water and fertile soil.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Desert Significance -->
        <div class="landform">
            <h2>3. Deserts</h2>
            <img src="images/pexels-the-trvlr-1731660.jpg" alt="Desert Diagram" class="landform-diagram">
            <p><strong>Resource Rich:</strong> Deserts are home to valuable resources such as minerals, oil, and natural gas, which are crucial for industry.</p>
            <p><strong>Unique Ecosystems:</strong> Despite their harsh conditions, deserts support unique ecosystems and species that have adapted to extreme temperatures and lack of water.</p>
            <p><strong>Tourism:</strong> Deserts are popular destinations for tourism, offering distinct landscapes like sand dunes, oases, and unique wildlife.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Plateau Significance -->
        <div class="landform">
            <h2>4. Plateaus</h2>
            <img src="images/pexels-huseyi-n-avci-351050981-29452159.jpg" alt="Plateau Diagram" class="landform-diagram">
            <p><strong>Geological Importance:</strong> Plateaus provide significant geological insights, as they are often formed by tectonic uplift, volcanic activity, or erosion.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining and Resources:</strong> Many plateaus contain mineral resources like coal, iron, and natural gas, making them important for mining activities.</p>
            <p><strong>Biodiversity:</strong> Plateaus often harbor unique biodiversity due to their varied ecosystems, ranging from grasslands to forests.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- River Significance -->
        <div class="landform">
            <h2>5. Rivers</h2>
            <img src="images/pexels-samandgos-709552.jpg" alt="River Diagram" class="landform-diagram">
            <p><strong>Water Supply:</strong> Rivers are crucial sources of freshwater for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use.</p>
            <p><strong>Transport and Trade:</strong> Rivers have historically been used as important transportation routes for trade and travel.</p>
            <p><strong>Flood Control:</strong> Rivers help to control and regulate water flow, preventing excess water accumulation in nearby areas.</p>
